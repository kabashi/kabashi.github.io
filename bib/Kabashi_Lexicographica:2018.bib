  abstract  =    {ABSTRACT. For many applications in the field of
                  natural language processing, a lexicon is
                  needed. For the Albanian language a lexicon that can
                  be used for these purposes is presented below. The
                  lexicon contains around 75,000 entries, including
                  proper names such as personal, geographical and
                  other names. Each entry includes grammatical
                  information such as parts of speech and other
                  specific information, e.g. inflection classes for
                  nouns, adjectives and verbs. The lexicon is part of
                  a morphological tool, but can also be used as an
                  independent resource for other tasks and
                  applications or can be adapted for them. Sources for
                  the creation and the extension of the presented
                  lexicon include both information from traditional
                  dictionaries, e.g. spelling dictionaries, and a
                  balanced linguistic corpus using corpus- driven
                  methods and tools. The lexicon is still work in
                  progress, but aims to cover basic information for
                  most frequent tasks of natural language
                  processing.},
