 abstract  =    {ABSTRACT. We developed a method for creating
                  bilingual word lists and terms from parallel
                  Wikipedia versions. This consists of two steps, the
                  heuristic extraction of parallel sentences from
                  Wikipedia and the construction of robust word vector
                  embeddings for the creation of dictionaries. For the
                  heuristic extraction we align Wikipedia articles on
                  the same or similar topic and find corresponding
                  sentences and paragraphs. Therefore the combination
                  of similar structures of named entities and vector
                  embeddings is used. From these heuristic parallel
                  corpora, we construct a combination of task-specific
                  trained vector embeddings, experiment with a novel
                  alignment technique and similarities in the
                  document-term matrices. The methods provide distance
                  measurements of words between the languages and can
                  be used to create translation
                  dictionaries. Additionally, the measurements can be
                  used in combination with other methods, for example
                  as additional information for translation inference
                  across dictionaries. We create a German to Albanian
                  and an English to Albanian dictionary. As the method
                  works without additional labeled information beyond
                  Wikipedia, it can help low resource languages.},
