  abstract  = {The EmpiriST corpus (Bei√üwenger et al., 2016) is a manually tokenized and part-of-speech tagged corpus of approximately 23,000 tokens of German Web and CMC (computer-mediated communication) data. We extend the corpus with manually created annotation layers for word form normalization, lemmatization and lexical semantics. All annotations have been independently performed by multiple human annotators. We report inter-annotator agreements and results of baseline systems and state-of-the-art off-the-shelf tools.},
