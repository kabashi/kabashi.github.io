  abstract  =    {The EmpiriST corpus (Beißwenger et al., 2016) is a
                  manually tokenized and part-of-speech tagged corpus
                  of approximately 23,000 tokens of German Web and CMC
                  (computer-mediated communication) data. We extend
                  the corpus with manually created annotation layers
                  for word form normalization, lemmatization and
                  lexical semantics. All annotations have been
                  independently performed by multiple human
                  annotators. We report inter-annotator agreements and
                  results of baseline systems and state-of-the-art
                  off-the-shelf tools.},
