This paper provides the first overall description of the emerging OntoLex module for Frequency, Attestations, and Corpus-Based Information (OntoLex-FrAC) that is intended to complement OntoLex-Lemon with the necessary vocabulary to represent major types of information found in or automatically derived from corpora, for applications in both language technology and the language sciences.",
