### Albanian Corpus (AlCo) ###

The Albanian Corpus (AlCo) contains a hundred million word tokens
(text words), the first Albanian corpus of this size. The corpus
covers different domains of language and contains different text types
â€“ it is a reference corpus. At this moment the work is still in
progress, some texts still need to be replaced or recategorized. The
corpus is annotated with a morpho-syntactic tagset of 77 tags, since
2015. We use CQPweb, a web-based corpus analysis system, to explore
the corpus data.


### AlCoPress (2017-2019) ###

The Albanian Corpus of Press Texts (AlCo) contains around 32 million
word tokens (text words). The corpus is annotated like AlCo. We use
CQPweb, a web-based corpus analysis system, to explore the corpus
data.


### Buzuku (1555) Corpus ###

The Buzuku Corpus contains the text of "Missale" (1555) from Gjon
Buzuku.  The corpus is not annotated.
