  abstract  =    {ABSTRACT. For many applications in the field of
                  natural language processing, a lexicon is
                  needed. For the Albanian language a lexicon that can
                  be used for these purposes is presented below. The
                  lexicon contains around 75,000 entries, including
                  proper names such as personal, geographical and
                  other names. Each entry includes grammatical
                  information such as parts of speech and other
                  specific information, e.g. inflection classes for
                  nouns, adjectives and verbs. The lexicon is part of
                  a morphological tool, but can also be used as an
                  independent resource for other tasks and
                  applications or can be adapted for them. Sources for
                  the creation and the extension of the presented
                  lexicon include both information from traditional
                  dictionaries, e.g. spelling dictionaries, and a
                  balanced linguistic corpus using corpus- driven
                  methods and tools. The lexicon is still work in
                  progress, but aims to cover basic information for
                  most frequent tasks of natural language
                  processing.},

The novel collocation component of OntoLex-FrAC is described in application to a lexicographic resource and corpus-based collocation scores available from the web, and finally, we demonstrate the capability and genericity of the model by showing how to retrieve and aggregate collocation information by means of SPARQL, and its export to a tabular format, so that it can be easily processed in downstream applications.},

In this fifth edition, the participating systems were asked to generate new translations automatically among three languages - English, French, Portuguese - based on known indirect translations contained in the Apertium RDF graph. Such evaluation pairs have been the same during the four last TIAD editions. Since the fourth edition, however, a larger graph is used as a basis to produce the translations, namely Apertium RDF v2. The evaluation of the results was carried out by the organisers against manually compiled language pairs of K Dictionaries. For the second time in the TIAD series, some systems beat the proposed baselines. This paper gives an overall description of the shard task, the evaluation data and methodology, and the systems’ results.},

 abstract  =    {ABSTRACT. We developed a method for creating
                  bilingual word lists and terms from parallel
                  Wikipedia versions. This consists of two steps, the
                  heuristic extraction of parallel sentences from
                  Wikipedia and the construction of robust word vector
                  embeddings for the creation of dictionaries. For the
                  heuristic extraction we align Wikipedia articles on
                  the same or similar topic and find corresponding
                  sentences and paragraphs. Therefore the combination
                  of similar structures of named entities and vector
                  embeddings is used. From these heuristic parallel
                  corpora, we construct a combination of task-specific
                  trained vector embeddings, experiment with a novel
                  alignment technique and similarities in the
                  document-term matrices. The methods provide distance
                  measurements of words between the languages and can
                  be used to create translation
                  dictionaries. Additionally, the measurements can be
                  used in combination with other methods, for example
                  as additional information for translation inference
                  across dictionaries. We create a German to Albanian
                  and an English to Albanian dictionary. As the method
                  works without additional labeled information beyond
                  Wikipedia, it can help low resource languages.},
